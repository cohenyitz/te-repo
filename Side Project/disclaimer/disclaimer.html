                    TESTIMONIALS DISCLAIMER: Testimonials found at DuChanvre.us and/or from Du Chanvre LLC are unverified 
                    results, and may not reflect the typical purchaser’s experience, may not apply to the average person 
                    and are not intended to represent or guarantee that anyone will achieve the same or similar results. 
                    If we have disclosed typical results based on information provided to us by a manufacturer or other 
                    reputable third party source, you should presume that the typical results as stated are more reliable 
                    than the testimonials and other examples found at DuChanvre.us and/or from Du Chanvre LLC. However, 
                    you should always perform due diligence and not take such results at face value. We are not responsible 
                    for any errors or omissions in typical results information supplied to us by manufacturers or other reputable 
                    third parties. If a product or service is new, you understand that it may not have been available for purchase 
                    long enough to provide an accurate results history. Again, it is possible that even with perfect use of the 
                    product, you will not achieve the results described in testimonials. They are meant to be a showcase of the best 
                    results the product has produced, and should not be taken as the results a typical user will get.
