# Java Jam, the ultimate fighting machine!

Author: Joe Erickson, Tech Elevator

Java Jam is a program I put together to show my students at Tech Elevator more examples of Polymorphism and Inheritance in a fun little program that lets you model epic battles between two opponents and their mythical weapons.

You can make new fighters by implementing the Fightable interface or extending one of the existing fighting classes. Create fighters that are vulnerable to different kinds of weapons. Make fighters that are small and quick or hit point sacks of hard hitting power.

You can make a new weapon by implementing the Strikable interface or extending one of the weapon classes. Create mythical weapons that deal ice, fire or necromantic damage. Create hard hitting weapons that need time to recharge or quick weapons that, while not dealing much damage per strike, can deal more than one strike per round.
