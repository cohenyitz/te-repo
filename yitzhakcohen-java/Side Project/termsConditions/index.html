            <div><b>
            </b></div>

Products not purchased from this website, a partnering Du Chanvre owned website, or participants of Du Chanvre’s Authorized Reseller Program are absent Product part 3 as defined above, and are thus not suited for resell, lest an incomplete and thus materially different product be sold in violation of Du Chanvre’s trademark. Warranties and protections offered purchasers when purchasing Products from Du Chanvre, or from participants in Du Chanvre’s Authorized Reseller Program cannot be sold or purchased, and are held exclusively by Du Chanvre, or conferred contractually to participants in Du Chanvre’s Authorized Reseller Program. As all commercially available parts of Du Chanvre Products as defined above cannot be purchased from Du Chanvre, or a participant in Du Chanvre’s Authorized Reseller Program, or acquired through any means other than contractual agreement with Du Chanvre as part of the Authorized Reseller Program; You acknowledge not to resell Du Chanvre products purchased absent an Authorized Reseller Agreement, lest You violate Du Chanvre’s trademark for the sale and distribution of Du Chanvre Products containing ‘material differences’ from Products sold using Du Chanvre’s authorized channels of distribution. By acknowledging and agreeing to these terms, you further acknowledge any unauthorized resell as described above to be in violation of U.S.Trademark law, as an excepted party to the First Sale Doctrine, due to the sale or distribution of Du Chanvre Products, which exhibit a ‘material difference’ (id est. no consumer protection or warranties that Du Chanvre is bound by the FTC or contractually to honor) from products offered by Du Chanvre, Du Chanvre affiliated websites, or participants in Du Chanvre’s Authorized Reseller Program.
